How to burnout in your SaaS development 101:

Ignore customer feedback
Push new updates without testing
Don’t track who is interested in your product
Forget about your personal life, your startup needs you 24/7
Keep adding fancy features and avoiding the work on the core ones
Skip writing documentation, who needs that anyway?
Don’t delegate, you know everything best right?
Add a few more meetings to your calendar
Always add new tech stacks
Don’t work async

## This vs that

1st time SaaS founder:

- Builds for 8 months
- Tweaks the landing page for 2 months
- “Maybe this logo color would work better”

2nd time SaaS founder:

- Thinks in weeks, not months
- 80% marketing, 20% building
- “I only have 100 people signed up, I still need more validation”

Think like the 2nd founder.
