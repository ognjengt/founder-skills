Me validating a SaaS in 2018:

- Spend 20 hours browsing Google & Quora
- Manage 7 Google Docs
- "Is it really worth building this?"

Me building a SaaS in 2025:

Grammarly has a Plagiarism Checker

Reduce friction.

In reality you should learn how to use them in sync.

→ Perplexity for deep research
→ ChatGPT for prompt optimization
→ Claude for long-form reasoning

→ Cursor for coding

Master all 5 and you’ll become unstoppable.
