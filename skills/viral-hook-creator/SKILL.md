# Viral Hook Creator

## Purpose
Generate 5-10 viral hook options using proven psychological patterns that create curiosity, provide value, and drive engagement. Hooks are optimized for social platforms (X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok).

---

## Before Task Execution
Mandatory pre-processing and checks.

### Check for Business Context
Before starting, check if `FOUNDER_CONTEXT.md` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and use the business context to personalize your output (industry/niche terminology, target audience pain points, brand voice and tone, company positioning and authority, key metrics/achievements).
- If it doesn't exist, proceed without it but note that you may need to ask clarifying questions about business context.

### Pre-Processing Checklist
- Identify the content topic/theme.
- Identify the target platform (X, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, general).
- Identify the goal (awareness, education, engagement, conversion).
- Identify the target audience demographics and psychographics.
- Identify available social proof (stats, achievements, research).
- Detect missing critical information.

### Gather Information
Ask clarifying questions **only if the information is missing or unclear**.

Possible questions include:
- What is the main topic or message of your content?
- Which platform is this for? (X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, or general)
- What's your goal? (Build awareness, educate, drive engagement, get clicks)
- Do you have any stats, achievements, or data to reference? (e.g., "I analyzed 500 posts", "I made $100K in 30 days")
- What emotion should this evoke? (Curiosity, urgency, inspiration, shock)

Rules:
- Ask a maximum of **5 short questions**.
- Ask only questions that block correct execution.
- Do not ask questions if reasonable defaults can be used.
- If assumptions are made, document them in Notes.

---

## Writing Rules
Hard constraints. No interpretation.

### Core Rules
- Maximum 280 characters for X/Twitter hooks.
- Maximum 1-2 lines (40-60 characters) for video hooks.
- Lead with the most interesting element.
- Create a curiosity gap (promise value but withhold details).
- Use specific numbers when possible (not "many" but "17").
- Avoid clickbait that doesn't deliver.
- Use power words: steal, secret, mistake, never, proven, blueprint.
- No emojis unless platform-specific (Instagram/TikTok OK, LinkedIn/X avoid).
- No fluff or filler words.
- Active voice only.
- Present tense preferred.

### Pattern-Specific Rules
- For authority hooks: Lead with credible metric.
- For list hooks: Use odd numbers (7 > 6, 5 > 4).
- For story hooks: Start with unexpected outcome.
- For data hooks: Lead with surprising stat.
- For cautionary hooks: Lead with mistake/lesson.

### Platform-Specific Adaptations
- **X/Twitter**: Punchy, contrarian, data-driven, 280 char max.
- **LinkedIn**: Professional, achievement-oriented, thought leadership, 40-60 char first line.
- **Instagram**: Visual promise, lifestyle-oriented, aspirational, 125 char before "more" cutoff.
- **TikTok**: Fast-paced, relatable, trend-aware, 20-30 char on-screen text.
- **General**: Versatile, platform-agnostic.

- Each hook uses a different psychological pattern.
- Hooks are differentiated enough to provide real options.
- Character limits are respected for specified platform.
- At least one contrarian/unexpected hook is included.
- Hooks avoid overused phrases ("game changer", "secret sauce", etc.).
- Recommendations are backed by psychological/platform rationale.
